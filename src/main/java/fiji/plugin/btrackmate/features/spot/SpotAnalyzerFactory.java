/**
 * Interface for factories that can generate a {@link SpotAnalyzer} configured
 * to operate on a specific frame of a model.
 * <p>
 * Concrete implementation should declare what features they can compute
 * numerically, and make this info available in the
 * {@link fiji.plugin.btrackmate.providers.SpotAnalyzerProvider} that returns
 * them.
 * <p>
 * Feature key names are for historical reason all capitalized in an enum
 * manner. For instance: POSITION_X, MAX_INTENSITY, etc... They must be suitable
 * to be used as a attribute key in an xml file.
