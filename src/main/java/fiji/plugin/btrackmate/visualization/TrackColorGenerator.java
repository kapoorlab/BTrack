/**
 * Interface for functions that can generate track colors, <b>with a different
 * color for each vertex and edge</b>. This allow more detailed views, but is
 * most likely more costly in memory and computation time.
 * <p>
 * The spot coloring can seem to be redundant with individual spot coloring
 * defined elsewhere. However, it must be noted that this interface is intended
 * for <b>track coloring</b>, and is applied to spots in tracks only. Concrete
 * implementations of {@link TrackMateModelView} decide whether they abide to
 * individual spot coloring or spots within tracks coloring (this interface).
