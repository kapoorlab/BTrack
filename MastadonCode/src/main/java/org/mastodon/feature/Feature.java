 * Interface for Mastodon features.

 * consistency. They are typically defined for a specific application by the
 * user; they are optional and their selection and calculation are triggered at
 * runtime.

 * A Feature is defined for a specific target in the model (vertex, edge, graph,
 * etc.) specified as a type parameter of this class.

 * @param <T>
